# Analysis: Kotlin symbols

An internal symbols-based implementation for [analysis-kotlin-api](../analysis-kotlin-api), also known as K2 or 
"the new compiler".

Contains no stable public API and must not be used by anyone directly, only via [analysis-kotlin-api](../analysis-kotlin-api).

Can be added as a runtime dependency by the runner.
