# Developer guides

The purpose of the Developer guides documentation is to get you acquainted with Dokka's internals so that you can 
start developing your own plugins or contributing features and fixes to Dokka itself.

If you want to start hacking on Dokka right away, the only thing you need to be aware of is the
[general workflow](workflow.md): it will teach you how to build, debug and test Dokka locally.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) contains information that can be useful 
if you want to contribute to Dokka.

If you want to get into plugin development quick, see
[Introduction to plugin development](plugin-development/introduction.md).

If you have time to spare and want to know more about Dokka's internals, its architecture and capabilities, follow
[Architecture overview](architecture/architecture_overview.md) and subsequent sections inside `Internals`.

Having read through all the developer guides, you'll have a pretty good understanding of Dokka and how to develop
for it. 

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with maintainers via [Slack](community/slack.md) or 
[GitHub](https://github.com/kotlin/dokka).
