/**
 * hack for shadow jar and fastutil because of kotlin-compiler
 *
 * KT issue: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-47150
 *
 * what is happening here?
 *   fastutil is removed from shadow-jar completely,
 *   instead we declare a maven RUNTIME dependency on fastutil;
 *   this dependency will be fetched by Gradle at build time (as any other dependency from maven-central)
 *
 * why do we need this?
 *   because `kotlin-compiler` artifact includes unshaded (not-relocated) STRIPPED `fastutil` dependency,
 *   STRIPPED here means, that it doesn't provide full `fastutil` classpath, but only a part of it which is used
 *   and so when shadowJar task is executed it takes classes from `fastutil` from `kotlin-compiler` and adds it to shadow-jar
 *   then adds all other classes from `fastutil` coming from `markdown-jb`,
 *   but because `fastutil` from `kotlin-compiler` is STRIPPED, some classes (like `IntStack`) has no some methods
 *   and so such classes are not replaced afterward by `shadowJar` task - it visits every class once
 *
