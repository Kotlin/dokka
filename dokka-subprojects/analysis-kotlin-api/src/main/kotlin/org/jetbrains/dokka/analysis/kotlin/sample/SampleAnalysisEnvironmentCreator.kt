     * Creates and configures the sample analysis environment for a limited-time use.
     *
     * Configuring a sample analysis environment is a rather expensive operation that takes up additional
     * resources since Dokka needs to configure and analyze source roots additional to the main ones.
     * It's best to limit the scope of use and the lifetime of the created environment
     * so that the resources could be freed as soon as possible.
     *
     * No specific cleanup is required by the caller - everything is taken care of automatically
     * as soon as you exit the [block] block.
     *
     * Usage example:
     * ```kotlin
     * // create a short-lived environment and resolve all the needed samples
     * val sample = sampleAnalysisEnvironmentCreator.use {
     *     resolveSample(sampleSourceSet, "org.jetbrains.dokka.sample.functionName")
     * }
     * // process the samples
     * // ...
     * ```
     */

     *
     * **WARNING**: This function offers a considerable amount of freedom and with it,
     * the potential to misuse the API.
     * A [SampleAnalysisEnvironment] once created needs to be manually closed
     * otherwise it could lead to memory leaks, concurrency issues or other unexpected problems.
     *
     * Therefore, it's safest to use it through the [SampleAnalysisEnvironmentCreator.use]
     * as it provides a controlled environment where everything is taken care of automatically.
     *
     * @return a new instance of [SampleAnalysisEnvironment]
