# Javadoc plugin

The Javadoc plugin adds a Javadoc output format that looks like Java's Javadoc HTML, but it's for the most part
a lookalike, so you may experience problems if you try to use it with a tool that expects native
Javadoc documentation generated by Java.

The Javadoc plugin is shipped with the Dokka Gradle Plugin, so you can start using it right away with one of the following 
tasks:

* `dokkaJavadoc` - builds Javadoc documentation for single-project builds or for a specific module.
* `dokkaJavadocCollector` - collects generated Javadoc documentation from submodules and assembles it together.

The Javadoc plugin has its own signature provider that essentially translates Kotlin signatures to Java ones.

To use it with Maven or the CLI runner, you have to add it as a dependency. You can find it on
[Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.dokka/javadoc-plugin).

**This plugin is at its early stages**, so you may experience issues and encounter bugs. Feel free to
[report](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/issues/new/choose) any errors you see.
