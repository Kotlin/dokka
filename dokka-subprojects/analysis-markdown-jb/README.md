# Ananlysis: Markdown (JetBrains)

An internal module that encapsulates Markdown file and format parsing by using `org.jetbrains:markdown` 
as the primary implementation dependency. 

Used by other Dokka modules, but it must not be used by external users directly until stable public API
is provided.
