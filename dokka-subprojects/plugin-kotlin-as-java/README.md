# Kotlin as Java plugin

With Kotlin as Java plugin applied, all Kotlin signatures will be rendered as Java signatures.

For instance, `fun foo(bar: Bar): Baz` will be rendered as `public final Baz foo(Bar bar)`.

The Kotlin as Java plugin is published to maven central as a
[separate artifact](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.dokka/kotlin-as-java-plugin):

```text
org.jetbrains.dokka:kotlin-as-java-plugin:1.9.20
```

**This plugin is at its early stages**, so you may experience issues and encounter bugs. Feel free to
[report](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/issues/new/choose) any errors you see.
