Documentable Model \u00b6 Documentable model represents parsed data, returned by compiler analysis. It retains basic order structure of parsed Psi or Descriptor models. After creation, it is a collection of trees, each with DModule as a root. After the Merge step, all trees are folded into one. The main building block of this model is Documentable class, that is a base class for all more specific types that represents elements of parsed Kotlin and Java classes with pretty self-explanatory names: DPackage , DFunction and so on. DClasslike is a base for class-like elements, such as Classes, Enums, Interfaces and so on. There are three non-documentable classes important for the model: DRI , SourceSetDependent and ExtraProperty . DRI (Dokka Resource Identifier) is a unique value that identifies specific Documentable . All references to other documentables different than direct ownership are described using DRIs. For example, DFunction with parameter of type X has only X's DRI, not the actual reference to X's Documentable object. SourceSetDependent is a map that handles multiplatform data, by connecting platform-specific data, declared with either expect or actual modifier, to a particular Source Set ExtraProperty is used to store any additional information that falls outside of regular model. It is highly recommended to use extras to provide any additional information when creating custom Dokka plugins. This element is a bit more complex, so you can read more about how to use it below. ExtraProperty class usage \u00b6 ExtraProperty classes are used both by Documentable and Content models. To declare a new extra, you need to implement ExtraProperty interface. interface ExtraProperty < in C : Any > { interface Key < in C : Any , T : Any > { fun mergeStrategyFor ( left : T , right : T ): MergeStrategy < C > = MergeStrategy . Fail { throw NotImplementedError ( \"Property merging for $this is not implemented\" ) } } val key : Key < C , *> } It is advised to use following pattern when declaring new extras: data class CustomExtra ( [ any values relevant to your extra ] ): ExtraProperty < Documentable > { companion object : CustomExtra . Key < Documentable , CustomExtra > override val key : CustomExtra . Key < Documentable , *> = CustomExtra } Merge strategy for extras is invoked only if merged objects have different values for same Extra. If you don't expect it to happen, you can omit implementing mergeStrategyFor function. All extras for ContentNode and Documentable classes are stored in PropertyContainer<C : Any> class instances. The C generic class parameter limits the type of properties, that can be stored in the container - it must match generic C class parameter from ExtraProperty interface. For example, if you would create DFunction -only ExtraProperty , it will be limited to be added only to PropertyContainer<DFunction> . In following example we will create Documentable -only property, store it in the container and then retrieve its value: data class CustomExtra ( val customExtraValue : String ) : ExtraProperty < Documentable > { companion object : ExtraProperty . Key < Documentable , CustomExtra > override val key : ExtraProperty . Key < Documentable , *> = CustomExtra } val extra : PropertyContainer < DFunction > = PropertyContainer . withAll ( CustomExtra ( \"our value\" ) ) val customExtraValue : String ? = extra [ CustomProperty ] ?. customExtraValue You can also use extras as markers, without storing any data in them: object MarkerExtra : ExtraProperty < Any >, ExtraProperty . Key < Any , MarkerExtra > { override val key : ExtraProperty . Key < Any , *> = this } val extra : PropertyContainer < Any > = PropertyContainer . withAll ( MarkerExtra ) val isMarked : Boolean = extra [ MarkerExtra ] != null Documentation Model \u00b6 Documentation model is used along Documentable Model to store data obtained by parsing code commentaries. There are three important classes here: DocTag describes a specific documentation syntax element, for example: header, footer, list, link, raw text, paragraph, etc. TagWrapper described a whole comment description or a specific comment tag, for example: @See, @Returns, @Author; and holds consisting DocTag elements DocumentationNode acts as a container for TagWrappers for a specific Documentable DocumentationNodes are references by a specific Documentable Page Model \u00b6 Page Model represents the structure of future generated documentation pages and is independent of the final output format, which each node corresponding to exactly one output file. Renderer is processing each page separately.Subclasses of PageNode represents different kinds of rendered pages for Modules, Packages, Classes etc. The Page Model is a tree structure, with RootPageNode being the root. Content Model \u00b6 Content Model describes how the actual page content is presented. It organizes it's structure into groups, tables, links, etc. Each node is identified by unique DCI (Dokka Content Identifier) and all references to other nodes different than direct ownership are described using DCIs. DCI aggregates DRI s of all Documentables that make up specific ContentNode . Also, all ExtraProperty info from consisting Documentable s is propagated into Content Model and available for Renderer .","title":"Data model"},{"location":"developer_guide/data_model/#dokka-data-model","text":"There a four data models that Dokka uses: Documentable Model, Documentation Model, Page Model and Content Model.","title":"Dokka Data Model"},{"location":"developer_guide/data_model/#documentable-model","text":"Documentable model represents parsed data, returned by compiler analysis.

Setting up Kotlin and Java analysis process and initializing plugins \u00b6 The provided Maven / CLI / Gradle configuration is read.Then, all the DokkaPlugin classes are loaded and the extensions are created. No entry points here. Creating documentation models \u00b6 The documentation models are created. This step uses DokkaCore.sourceToDocumentableTranslator entry point. All extensions registered using this entry point will be invoked. Each of them is required to implement SourceToDocumentableTranslator interface: interface SourceToDocumentableTranslator { fun invoke ( sourceSet : SourceSetData , context : DokkaContext ): DModule } By default, two translators are created: DefaultDescriptorToDocumentableTranslator that handles Kotlin files DefaultPsiToDocumentableTranslator that handles Java files After this step, all data from different source sets and languages are kept separately. If you are using Kotlin it is recommended to make use of the asynchronous version, providing you implementation of invokeSuspending : interface AsyncSourceToDocumentableTranslator : SourceToDocumentableTranslator { suspend fun invokeSuspending ( sourceSet : DokkaConfiguration . DokkaSourceSet , context : DokkaContext ): DModule } Pre-merge documentation transform \u00b6 Here you can apply any transformation to model data before different source sets are merged. This step uses DokkaCore.preMergeDocumentableTransformer entry point. All extensions registered using this entry point will be invoked. Each of them is required to implement PreMergeDocumentableTransformer interface: interface PreMergeDocumentableTransformer { operator fun invoke ( modules : List < DModule >, context : DokkaContext ): List < DModule > } By default, three transformers are created: DocumentableVisibilityFilter that, depending on configuration, filters out all private members from declared packages ActualTypealiasAdder that handles Kotlin typealiases ModuleAndPackageDocumentationTransformer that creates documentation content for models and packages itself Merging \u00b6 All DModule instances are merged into one. This step uses DokkaCore.documentableMerger entry point. It is required to have exactly one extension registered for this entry point. Having more will trigger an error, unless only one is not overridden. The extension is required to implement DocumentableMerger interface: interface DocumentableMerger { operator fun invoke ( modules : Collection < DModule >, context : DokkaContext ): DModule } By default, DefaultDocumentableMerger is created. This extension is treated as a fallback, so it can be overridden by a custom one. Merged data transformation \u00b6 You can apply any transformation to already merged data This step uses DokkaCore.documentableTransformer entry point. All extensions registered using this entry point will be invoked. Each of them is required to implement DocumentableTransformer interface: interface DocumentableTransformer { operator fun invoke ( original : DModule , context : DokkaContext ): DModule } By default, InheritorsExtractorTransformer is created, that extracts inherited classes data across source sets and creates inheritance map. Creating page models \u00b6 The documentable model is translated into page format, that aggregates all tha data that will be available for different pages of documentation. This step uses DokkaCore.documentableToPageTranslator entry point. It is required to have exactly one extension registered for this entry point. Having more will trigger an error, unless only one is not overridden. The extension is required to implement DocumentableToPageTranslator interface: interface DocumentableToPageTranslator { operator fun invoke ( module : DModule ): ModulePageNode } By default, DefaultDocumentableToPageTranslator is created. This extension is treated as a fallback, so it can be overridden by a custom one. Transforming page models \u00b6 You can apply any transformations to paged data. This step uses DokkaCore.pageTransformer entry point. All extensions registered using this entry point will be invoked. Each of them is required to implement PageTransformer interface: interface PageTransformer { operator fun invoke ( input : RootPageNode ): RootPageNode } By default, two transformers are created: PageMerger merges some pages depending on MergeStrategy DeprecatedStrikethroughTransformer marks all deprecated members on every page Rendering \u00b6 All pages are rendered to desired format. This step uses DokkaCore.renderer entry point. It is required to have exactly one extension registered for this entry point. Having more will trigger an error, unless only one is not overridden. The extension is required to implement Renderer interface: interface Renderer { fun render ( root : RootPageNode ) } By default, only HtmlRenderer , that extends basic DefaultRenderer , is created, but it will be registered only if configuration parameter format is set to html . Using any other value without providing valid renderer will cause Dokka to fail. Multimodule page generation endpoints \u00b6 Multimodule page generation is a separate process, that declares two additional entry points: Multimodule page creation \u00b6 Generation of the page that points to all module for which we generates documentation. This step uses CoreExtensions.allModulePageCreator entry point. It is required to have exactly one extension registered for this entry point. Having more will trigger an error, unless only one is not overridden. The extension is required to implement PageCreator interface: interface PageCreator { operator fun invoke (): RootPageNode } By default, MultimodulePageCreator is created. This extension is treated as a fallback, so it can be replaced by a custom one. Multimodule page transformation \u00b6 Additional transformation that we might apply for multimodule page. This step uses CoreExtensions.allModulePageTransformer entry point. All extensions registered using this entry point will be invoked. Each of them is required to implement common PageTransformer interface. Default extensions' extension points \u00b6 Default core extension points already have an implementation for providing basic Dokka functionality. All of them are declared in DokkaBase plugin. If you don't want this default extensions to load, all you need to do is not load Dokka base and load your plugin instead. ```kotlin val customPlugin by configurations.creating dependencies { customPlugin(\"[custom plugin load signature]\") } tasks { val dokka by getting(DokkaTask::class) { pluginsConfig = alternativeAndIndependentPlugins outputDirectory = dokkaOutputDir outputFormat = \"html\" [...] } } You will then need to implement extensions for all core extension points. `DokkaBase` also register several new extension points, with which you can change default behaviour of `DokkaBase` extensions. In order to use them, you need to add `dokka-base` to you dependencies: ```kotlin compileOnly(\"org.jetbrains.dokka:dokka-base:<dokka_version>\") Then, you need to obtain DokkaBase instance using plugin function: class SamplePlugin : DokkaPlugin () { val dokkaBase = plugin < DokkaBase >() val extension by extending { dokkaBase . pageMergerStrategy with SamplePageMergerStrategy order { before ( dokkaBase . fallbackMerger ) } } } object SamplePageMergerStrategy : PageMergerStrategy { override fun tryMerge ( pages : List < PageNode >, path : List < String >): List < PageNode > { ... } } Following extension points are available with base plugin \u00b6 Entry point Function Required interface Used by Singular Preregistered extensions pageMergerStrategy determines what kind of pages should be merged PageMergerStrategy PageMerger false FallbackPageMergerStrategy SameMethodNamePageMergerStrategy commentsToContentConverter transforms comment model into page content model CommentsToContentConverter DefaultDocumentableToPageTransformer SignatureProvider true DocTagToContentConverter signatureProvider provides representation of methods signatures SignatureProvider DefaultDocumentableToPageTransformer true KotlinSignatureProvider locationProviderFactory provides LocationProvider instance that returns paths for requested elements LocationProviderFactory DefaultRenderer HtmlRenderer PackageListService true DefaultLocationProviderFactory which returns DefaultLocationProvider externalLocationProviderFactory provides ExternalLocationProvider instance that returns paths for elements that are not part of generated documentation ExternalLocationProviderFactory DefaultLocationProvider false JavadocExternalLocationProviderFactory DokkaExternalLocationProviderFactory outputWriter writes rendered pages files OutputWriter DefaultRenderer HtmlRenderer true FileWriter htmlPreprocessors transforms page content before HTML rendering PageTransformer DefaultRenderer HtmlRenderer false RootCreator SourceLinksTransformer NavigationPageInstaller SearchPageInstaller ResourceInstaller StyleAndScriptsAppender PackageListCreator samplesTransformer transforms content for code samples for HTML rendering SamplesTransformer HtmlRenderer true DefaultSamplesTransformer","title":"Extension points"},{"location":"developer_guide/extension_points/#extension-points","text":"","title":"Extension points"},{"location":"developer_guide/extension_points/#core-extension-points","text":"We will discuss all base extension points along with the steps, that DokkaGenerator does to build a documentation.","title":"Core extension points"},{"location":"developer_guide/extension_points/#setting-up-kotlin-and-java-analysis-process-and-initializing-plugins","text":"The provided Maven / CLI / Gradle configuration is read.Then, all the DokkaPlugin classes are loaded and the extensions are created.

To build it, use ./gradlew build . Alternatively, open the project directory in IntelliJ IDEA and use the IDE to build and run Dokka. Here's how to import and configure Dokka in IntelliJ IDEA 2019.3: Select \"Open\" from the IDEA welcome screen, or File > Open if a project is already open Select the directory with your clone of Dokka Note IDEA may have an error after the project is initally opened; it is OK to ignore this as the next step will address this error After IDEA opens the project, select File > New > Module from existing sources and select the build.gradle.kts file from the root directory of your Dokka clone After Dokka is loaded into IDEA, open the Gradle tool window (View > Tool Windows > Gradle) and click on the top left \"Refresh all Gradle projects\" button Configuration \u00b6 Dokka requires configured Kotlin plugin and dokka-core dependency. plugins { kotlin ( \"jvm\" ) version \"<kotlin_version>\" } dependencies { compileOnly ( \"org.jetbrains.dokka:dokka-core:<dokka_version>\" ) } tasks . withType < KotlinCompile > { kotlinOptions . jvmTarget = \"1.8\" } Building sample plugin \u00b6 In order to load a plugin into Dokka, your class must extend DokkaPlugin class. A fully qualified name of that class must be placed in a file named org.jetbrains.dokka.plugability.DokkaPlugin under resources/META-INF/services . All instances are automatically loaded during Dokka setup using java.util.ServiceLoader . Dokka provides a set of entry points, for which user can create their own implementations. They must be delegated using DokkaPlugin.extending(definition: ExtendingDSL.() -> Extension<T, *, *>) function,that returns a delegate ExtensionProvider with supplied definition. To create a definition, you can use one of two infix functions with(T) or providing( (DokkaContext) -> T) where T is the type of an extended endpoint. You can also use infix functions: applyIf( () -> Boolean ) to add additional condition specifying whether or not the extension should be used order((OrderDsl.() -> Unit)) to determine if your extension should be used before or after another particular extension for the same endpoint override( Extension<T, *, *> ) to override other extension. Overridden extension won't be loaded and overridding one will inherit ordering from it. Following sample provides custom translator object as a DokkaCore.sourceToDocumentableTranslator package org.jetbrains.dokka.sample import org.jetbrains.dokka.plugability.DokkaPlugin class SamplePlugin : DokkaPlugin () { extension by extending { DokkaCore . sourceToDocumentableTranslator with CustomSourceToDocumentableTranslator } } object CustomSourceToDocumentableTranslator : SourceToDocumentableTranslator { override fun invoke ( sourceSet : SourceSetData , context : DokkaContext ): DModule } Registering extension point \u00b6 You can register your own extension point using extensionPoint function declared in DokkaPlugin class class SamplePlugin : DokkaPlugin () { val extensionPoint by extensionPoint < SampleExtensionPointInterface >() } interface SampleExtensionPointInterface Obtaining extension instance \u00b6 All registered plugins are accessible with DokkaContext.plugin function.

For most mutli-platform projects you should assume that Dokka's source sets correspond to Kotlin plugin's source sets. All source sets are by default registered and configured automatically although test source sets are suppressed Kotlin kotlin { // Kotlin Multiplatform plugin configuration jvm () js ( \"customName\" ) } tasks . withType < DokkaTask >(). configureEach { // custom output directory outputDirectory . set ( buildDir . resolve ( \"dokka\" )) dokkaSourceSets { named ( \"customNameMain\" ) { // The same name as in Kotlin Multiplatform plugin, so the sources are fetched automatically includes . from ( \"packages.md\" , \"extra.md\" ) samples . from ( \"samples/basic.kt\" , \"samples/advanced.kt\" ) } register ( \"differentName\" ) { // Different name, so source roots must be passed explicitly displayName . set ( \"JVM\" ) platform . set ( org . jetbrains . dokka . Platform . jvm ) sourceRoots . from ( kotlin . sourceSets . getByName ( \"jvmMain\" ). kotlin . srcDirs ) sourceRoots . from ( kotlin . sourceSets . getByName ( \"commonMain\" ). kotlin . srcDirs ) } } } Note If you want to share the configuration between source sets, you can use Gradle's configureEach Applying plugins \u00b6 Dokka plugin creates Gradle configuration for each output format in the form of dokka${format}Plugin : dependencies { dokkaHtmlPlugin ( \"org.jetbrains.dokka:kotlin-as-java-plugin:1.4.20\" ) } You can also create a custom Dokka task and add plugins directly inside: val customDokkaTask by creating ( DokkaTask :: class ) { dependencies { plugins ( \"org.jetbrains.dokka:kotlin-as-java-plugin:1.4.20\" ) } } Important Please note that dokkaJavadoc task will properly document only single jvm source set To generate the documentation, use the appropriate dokka${format} Gradle task: ./gradlew dokkaHtml Some plugins can be configured separately using a plugin class and configuration class. For example: pluginConfiguration < DokkaBase , DokkaBaseConfiguration > { customAssets = listOf ( file ( \"<path to asset>\" )) customStyleSheets = listOf ( file ( \"<path to custom stylesheet>\" )) } Keep in mind, that this only works when using a buildscript (with the configured plugin on classpath) since it is not possible to import plugin's class without it. If you don't want to use a buildscript or use Kotlin version lower than 1.3.50 you can achieve the same behaviour manually: pluginsMapConfiguration . set ( mapOf ( \"<fully qualified plugin's name>\" to \"\"\"<json configuration>\"\"\" )) Android \u00b6 Important Make sure you apply Dokka after com.android.library and kotlin-android . buildscript { repositories { jcenter () } dependencies { classpath ( \"org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:${kotlin_version}\" ) classpath ( \"org.jetbrains.dokka:dokka-gradle-plugin:${dokka_version}\" ) } } repositories { jcenter () } apply ( plugin = \"com.android.library\" ) apply ( plugin = \"kotlin-android\" ) apply ( plugin = \"org.jetbrains.dokka\" ) dokkaHtml . configure { dokkaSourceSets { named ( \"main\" ) { noAndroidSdkLink . set ( false ) } } } Multi-module projects \u00b6 For documenting Gradle multi-module projects, you can use dokka${format}MultiModule tasks. tasks . dokkaHtmlMultiModule . configure { outputDirectory . set ( buildDir . resolve ( \"dokkaCustomMultiModuleOutput\" )) documentationFileName . set ( \"README.md\" ) } DokkaMultiModule depends on all Dokka tasks in the subprojects, runs them, and creates a toplevel page (based on the documentationFile ) with links to all generated (sub)documentations Example project \u00b6 Please see the Dokka Gradle example project for an example.","title":"Gradle"},{"location":"user_guide/gradle/usage/#using-the-gradle-plugin","text":"Important If you are upgrading from 0.10.x to a current release of Dokka, please have a look at our migration guide The preferred way is to use plugins block.
