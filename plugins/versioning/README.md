# Versioning plugin

Versioning plugin aims to provide the ability to host documentation for multiple versions of a library/application 
with seamless switching between them. This, in turn, provides better experience for readers.

Versioning plugin, its configuration and its use-cases are described in detail in 
[documentation](https://kotlin.github.io/dokka/1.7.20/user_guide/plugins/versioning-plugin/).

Visit [versioning-multimodule-example](../../examples/gradle/dokka-versioning-multimodule-example) project to see it
in action.
